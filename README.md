# A Zombie Shooter Game

### About

2D zombie shooter written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) programming language using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org).

This game is inspired by [Crimsonland](https://store.steampowered.com/app/262830): eliminate hordes of zombies that relentlessly chase after you. I endeavored to implement projectile ballistics as accurately as possible in a 2D setting, where bullets slow down over distance, resulting in decreased damage. The game features two camera modes: static (classic) and dynamic, which causes the screen to rotate with the player, creating a unique 2D first-person shooter experience. Various weapons and enemy types are included.

In the future, I plan to add animations, diverse locations with buildings, and RPG elements to create an open-world experience reminiscent of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. but in 2D. However, achieving these goals will require a considerable amount of time.
